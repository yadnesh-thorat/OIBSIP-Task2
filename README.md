# OIBSIP-Task2
ğŸŒŸExcited to Share My Latest Tribute Web PageğŸŒŸ
I've recently completed a task about creating web page in (Level 2 Task 2) at
internship Oasis Infobyte where I created a web page dedicated to "Albert Einstein:A Legacy of Curiosity and Discovery" I admire. 
This project was a fantastic way to apply my basic HTML and CSS skills in a meaningful way.
